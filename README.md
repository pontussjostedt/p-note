# p-note (Archived)
Program aimed at replacing onenote for me. It is archived for the following reasons:
1. unvolatile storage is currently a pain and bodgy. Should remake with some form of database.
2. The combination of swing and javafx does not play nice enough. In particular the Webviewer crashes upon loading larger websites. This is a dealbreaker. 


## Showcase:

### Swing component interaction:
